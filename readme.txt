predefined styles. Bibtex source file and a link to the publication
are also available from the HTML. 

Features:

* Input data directly from the bibtex text file

* Template based HTML generation
* Possibility of filtering the bibtex entries based on their type (allow, deny)
* Possibility to access the single bibtex entry source code to enable copy&paste (toggle-enabled visualization)
* Possibility of editing the bibtex file directly from the wordpress administration page
* Adds the possibility of writing a text with references to a bibtex entries, and to print the bibliography at the end.
* Auto-detection of PDF files based on the BibTeX key
* Publications can be grouped and sorted in various ways

The papercite plugin has been developed and tested under Wordpress
3.1. It is based on bib2html version 0.9.3.
