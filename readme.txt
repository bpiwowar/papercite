Papercite helps to format bibtex entries to display a bibliography or
cite papers.

== Description ==

papercite format bibtex entries as HTML so they can be inserted in
WordPress pages and posts. The input data is a bibtex file (either
local or remote) and entries can be formatted by default using various 
predefined styles. Bibtex source file and a link to the publication
are also available from the HTML. 

Features:

* Input data directly from the bibtex text file
* Source files can be URL (e.g., from citeulike.org and bibsonomy.org)
* Template based HTML generation
* Possibility of filtering the bibtex entries based on their type (allow, deny)
* Possibility to access the single bibtex entry source code to enable copy&paste (toggle-enabled visualization)
* Possibility of editing the bibtex file directly from the wordpress administration page
* Adds the possibility of writing a text with references to a bibtex entries, and to print the bibliography at the end.
* Auto-detection of PDF files based on the BibTeX key
* Publications can be grouped and sorted in various ways

The papercite plugin has been developed and tested under Wordpress
3.1. Versions before 0.3 were based on bib2html version 0.9.3.

Alternatively, you can maintain your updated biblilography by using systems such as citeulike.org and bibsonomy.org; 
specify the bib file using as a URL (e.g., in citeulike, you should use http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/username)
